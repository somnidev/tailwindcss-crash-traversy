## What is Tailwind?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) framework with predefined classes that you can use to build and design web pages directly in your markup. It lets you write CSS in your HTML in the form of predefined classes.

There is a good introduction to Tailwind at [How to Use Tailwind CSS to Rapidly Develop Snazzy Websites](https://kinsta.com/blog/tailwind-css/).

## Installation Instructions

The simplest and fastest way to get up and running with Tailwind CSS from scratch is with the Tailwind CLI tool. The CLI is also available as a standalone executable if you want to use it without installing Node.js.

```bash
npm init
```

### Install Tailwind CSS

Install tailwindcss via npm, and create your tailwind.config.js file.

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

### Configure your template paths

Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file. Remember to include your HTML entry point if applicable - see [Pattern recommendations](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#pattern-recommendations).

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
    content: [
        './dist/index.html',
        "./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
    theme: {
      extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
  }
```

### Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS

Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your main CSS file. 

This is why we create a folder `src` and  a file called `style.css`` and paste that and then save.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Start the Tailwind CLI build process

Now we run the CLI tool to scan your template files for classes and build your CSS.

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/style.css -o ./dist/style.css --watch
```

## Create Tailwind Components

### Create a Button

Now let's create a component. We'll create a simple button, so in our HTML
here let's go ahead and add a button tag and just going to use Emmet to add some classes here so for the color will do another blue but different shade let's do 500 and I want to add a color for the
text so we can use text - and then a color I'm going to use white if we want to make it bold we can use font and bold.

```html
button.bg-sky-200.text-white.font-bold.py-2.px-4.my-5.rounded
```

This is the resulting html.

```html
    <button class="bg-sky-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 my-5 rounded">Find Friends</button>
```

we have our button and notice there's no BTN class or anything like that like you would find in traditional frameworks
it's me it's all made up of these low-level utility classes and what's really cool is if we want a hover effect
we don't have to add any extra CSS or anything we can simply add a hover
: and then whatever we want so for instance the color will do blue 400.
